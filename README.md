# Photography

A website for my personal photography. Available at https://photos.mgechev.com.

## Developing

To start the development server just run:

```
ng serve
```

To deploy:

```
yarn build
git commit -am 'New deployment'
git push
```

The build command will create a production build of the app and a `CNAME` file in `docs`.
